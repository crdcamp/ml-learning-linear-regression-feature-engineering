# The never-ending learning journey continues

Welcome to yet another intermediary step in my ML learning journey. Here, I'm effectively filling in the prerequisites for my next linear regression practice application. These lessons primarily involve exploratory data analysis and feature engineering; two topics that I've been putting off for the sake of developing my first model (found in my [lin-reg-practice repository](https://github.com/crdcamp/lin-reg-practice)).

Some lighter requirements include finally familiarizing myself with plotting in Python (way overdue), using Scikit-Learn's `Pipeline` feature for cleaner code, and exploring some of the more simple methods of numeric transformations. More advanced numeric transformations will be explored on a case-by-case basis.

To summarize, I'm preparing for a more thorough linear regression application where I attempt to get the errors as low as I possibly can. A thank you to any viewer who actually inspects the dull contents of this repository. At the end of the day, these really aren't the most exciting topics.
